# Mental Health in the Tech Industry: A Data-Driven Exploration

## 🧠 Project Overview
The tech industry is fast-paced, constantly evolving, and demands that employees stay up-to-date with the latest tools and trends. This continuous pressure can lead to chronic stress and mental health challenges. Our project aims to explore this issue using data, uncover its root causes, and evaluate how companies are responding.

Some companies have started recognizing the importance of mental well-being and offer support programs—but:

- Are these efforts making a real difference?
- Are employees willing to seek help?
- Are there misconceptions or stigmas that prevent people from speaking up about their mental health?

These are the questions we set out to answer.

## 👥 Target Audience
- HR professionals  
- Tech companies and decision-makers

## 🧹 Data Preparation
We began by cleaning and modeling the data using a **Star Schema** approach. We ensured high data quality through:

- ✅ Completeness  
- ✅ Uniqueness  
- ✅ Consistency  
- ✅ Validation  

## 📊 Analysis
We conducted both **descriptive** and **diagnostic** analyses to identify influencing factors such as:

- Gender  
- Age  
- Family history  

However, the most powerful factor turned out to be: **company culture**.

## ❓ Key Question
> In the final presentation, we asked:  
> _Does company culture truly support mental health?_  
> _Do employees feel safe enough to ask for help?_  
> _Or are there stigmas and misconceptions that hold them back?_
